# Aling Jackie's POS and Inventory

### Setup

1. In `server`:

- create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`
- activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (`.venv/Scripts/activate` for Windows)
- install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run Flask server with `python app.py`

2. In `client`:

- install dependencies with `npm i`
- run server with `npm run dev`

### Guide

Both servers need to be active at the same time for the application to function as a whole.
